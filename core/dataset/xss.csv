" For example, speech-to-speech translation, continuously transcribed speech texts need segmented fed subsequent machine translation systems (Takezawa et al",0
", 1998; Nakamura, 2009)",0
" This current machine translation (MT) systems perform translation sentence level, various models used MT trained segmented sentences many algorithms inside MT exponential complexity regard length inputs",0
 The punctuation prediction problem attracted research interest speech processing community natural language processing community,0
" Most previous work primarily exploits local features statistical models lexicons, prosodic cues hidden event language model (HELM) (Liu et al",0
", 2005; Matusov et al",0
", 2006; Huang Zweig, 2002; Stolcke Shriberg, 1996)",0
 The word-level models integrating local features narrow views input could achieve satisfied performance due limited context information access (Favre et al,0
", 2008)",0
" Naturally, global contexts required model punctuation prediction, especially long-range dependencies",0
" For instance, English question sentences, ending question mark long-range dependent initial phrases (Lu Ng, 2010), could Figure 1",0
 There work trying incorporate syntactic features broaden view hypotheses punctuation prediction models (Roark et al,0
", 2006; Favre et al",0
", 2008)",0
" In methods, punctuation prediction treated separated post-procedure parsing, may suffer problem error propagation",0
" In addition, approaches able incrementally process inputs efficient long inputs, especially cases long transcribed speech texts presentations number streaming words could larger hundreds thousands",0
" In paper, propose jointly performing punctuation prediction transition-based dependency parsing transcribed speech text",0
" When transition-based parsing consumes stream words left right shift-reduce decoding algorithm, punctuation symbols predicted word based contexts parsing tree",0
 Two models proposed cause punctuation prediction interact transition actions parsing,0
 One conduct transition actions parsing followed punctuation predictions cascaded way,0
" The associate conventional transition actions parsing punctuation perditions, predicted punctuations directly inferred parsing tree",0
 Our models linear complexity capable handling streams words length,0
" In addition, computation models use rich set syntactic features, improve complicated punctuation predictions global view, especially long range dependencies",0
 Figure 1 shows example parsing helps punctuation prediction transcribed speech text,0
" As illustrated Figure 1(b), two commas predicted preceding words act adverbial modifiers (advmod) parsing",0
 The period word menu predicted parsing adverbial clause modifier (advcl) completed,0
" The question mark end input determined direct object modifier (dobj) identified, together long range clue auxiliary word occurs nominal subject (nsubj)",0
" Eventually, two segmentations formed according punctuation prediction results, shown Figure 1(c)",0
" The training data used models adapted Treebank data excluding punctuations keeping punctuation contexts, simulate unavailable annotated transcribed speech texts",0
" In decoding, beam search used get optimal punctuation prediction results",0
 We conduct experiments IWSLT data TDT4 test data sets,0
 The experimental results show method achieve higher performance CRF-based baseline method,0
 The paper structured follows: Section 2 conducts survey related work,0
 The transitionbased dependency parsing introduced Section 3,0
 We explain approach predicting punctuations transcribed speech texts Section 4,0
 Section 5 gives results experiment,0

" (2001), Liu et al",0
" (2005) integrate prosodic features (pitch, pause duration, etc",0
") lexical features (words, n-grams, etc",0
") predict punctuation symbols speech recognition, Huang Zweig (2002) uses maximum entropy model, Christensen et al",0
" (2001) focus finite state multi-layer perceptron methods, Liu et al",0
 (2005) uses conditional random fields,0
" However, scenarios prosodic cues available due inaccessible original raw speech waveforms",0
 Matusov et al,0
 (2006) integrate segmentation features log-linear model statistical machine translation (SMT) framework improve translation performance translating transcribed speech texts,0
 Lu Ng (2010) uses dynamic conditional random fields perform sentence boundary sentence type prediction,0

 This time warned independent Scotland would required join Europe-wide free-travel zone condition EU membership ,0
 Cue stories passport controls Berwick barbed wire border along Hadrian &apos;s Wall ,0
" True , Strathclyde paper pointed possible economic benefits freer movement rest Europe , though - predictably - figure headlines ",0
 Nor anyone point EU member states spend much time bending formal rules suits ,0
" Since Scotland &apos;t Schengen area , continued non-compliance would cheap concession Brussels offer return whatever really wanted Scots ",0
" So , non-story , ",0
 And one long tooth become fossilised: I first heard &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; canard least 40 years ago ,0
 Yet interesting point lost retelling whiskery old tale ,0
" Why independent Scotland expected Europe &apos;s bidding , anyway ? Why trade London &apos;s yoke Brussels , especially ? Here real European news: great , post-war plan unite Europe finally stalled ",0
" With euro crisis , Project Europe officially dead ",0
" Across EU , parties dedicated opposing EU , scrapping euro common currency , gaining ground ",0
" Even Germany , Eurosceptic Alternative Germany Party - founded year - came nowhere grab nearly five million votes September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively knocking Free Democrats (equivalent Lib Dems) Bundestag ",0
 There always domestic opposition plan create federal Europe ,0
" However , current economic crisis proved watershed ",0
" The austerity imposed Berlin European Central Bank , coupled straitjacket imposed national economies adherence common currency , led many people think Project Europe gone far ",0
 The crisis euro little national governments running excessive budget deficits - true Greece ,0
" Rather , euro system locked members exchange rates favourable German exporters - something German politicians want keep ",0
" Without possibility domestic currency devaluation , southern Europe finds built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany ",0
 The recourse slash wages public spending - spurred Berlin ,0
 Beyond current budget currency problems lies deeper European productivity malaise ,0
" As result &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed Brussels - code subsidising French German energy firms consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice much electricity , four times much gas , United States ",0
" That crippling cost disadvantage , &apos;ve already seen Grangemouth ",0
 All wage freezes world &apos;t stop European petrochemicals industry hammered cheap US shale gas ,0
" As result , revolt brewing , especially France , EU &apos;s main cheerleader ",0
" After war , French political elite saw EU vehicle keep Germany check , give Paris equal billing world Washington ",0
" But Berlin longer needs Paris passport political legitimacy imposed economic policy Europe , leaving battered French economy struggling ",0
" Result: Marine Le Pen &apos;s right-wing , anti-EU National Front crucial by-election , knocking ruling Socialists third place ",0
 The Front popular party France 24 per cent vote - timely warning British Labour &apos;t assume split right automatically favour left ,0
" What Le Pen newfound popularity among French white , working class ? She wants use next year &apos;s EU elections create anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc across European Parliament ",0
" If , possible , anti-EU parties well elections , bloc could dominate European Parliament first time ",0
 Here &apos;s point: sometime soon growing anti-EU anti-common currency feeling Europe coalesce kill euro ,0
" The EU &apos;t disappear , revert something like loose &quot; Europe (Sovereign) Nations &quot; favoured General de Gaulle ",0
 Germany satellite economies might keep euro France southern Europe revive currencies ,0
" I expect UK distance project , hoping cosy US ",0
" However , Washington &apos;s growing interest Pacific suggests Britain left Atlantic cold ",0
 Where leave Scotland ? We choose region (essentially) Little England ,0
 Or defend economic interests - includes telling Berlin Brussels get ,0
 I suspect Scotland could well inside looser European arrangement provided kept currency ,0
 Co-operation like-minded countries easier non-federal Europe Nations ,0
 Otherwise consider emulating Norway retaining economic independence ,0
" The SNP government Scotland - remarkably-- successful anti-austerity political movement Europe , spectacular majority 2011 basis opposing cuts proposed (and implemented) Labour &apos;s chancellor Alistair Darling subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition ",0
 It would ridiculous Scotland vote independence accept austerity imposed Berlin Brussels ,0

" With Burfien , regional church first time commissioned minister work full time , endeavouring inspire young people study theology ",0
" At present , fewer fewer young people deciding study theology Abitur examinations (equivalent A levels)",0
" Burfien puts process secularisation: &quot; God &apos;s voice quiet , world loud &quot; ",0
 The job characterised great freedom variety ,0
 I master schedule therefore turn focus important ,0
" As pastoral workers , ministers close people ",0
 They earn much teachers make good living ,0
" Of course wages higher within private sector , hand , theologians secure employer ",0
" This would suit young people today , career , meaningful job well ",0
" According information Regional Church , covers three quarters Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors retire every year ",0

" &quot; The local authorities satisfied , &quot; emphasised Maier ",0

" The Mayor considers right decision Winterlingen handed responsibility building someone else winter , thus longer pay upkeep building , heating , tending garden clearing pavement ",0
" &quot; This expense offloaded , &quot; Maier glad say ",0

" A chips , coke , burger - straight home bed ! However , way home clear differences hungry clubbers become evident ",0
" What wrong people continually throw fast food bags car window ? ! At weekend particular , discarded paper bags found side road car parks ",0
 &quot; Why ? &quot; I ask ,0
" Are people stupid take bags home throw nearest rubbish bin ? After , waste paper spoil landscape ",0
" Bags also seen covering transport facilities crash barriers , thus causing accidents ",0
" However , so-called &quot; throwaway society &quot; think things ",0
 They probably even know term even means ,0
" If often evening , often several people car , know back seat look like partied night: clothes , bottles rubbish begin pile ",0
 A bags &apos;t make much difference - contrast street no-one wants trample peoples &apos; leftover food ,0
 I see day coming towns municipalities get fed clearing - fast food chains operate deposit scheme bags ,0
" FAA: Air passengers use gadgets planes (but make cell phone calls) Airline passengers able use electronic devices gate-to-gate read , work , play games , watch movies listen music - talk cellphones - much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday Federal Aviation Administration ",0
 But passengers &apos;t expect changes happen immediately ,0
" How fast change implemented vary airline , FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said news conference ",0
 Airlines show FAA airplanes meet new guidelines &apos;ve updating flight crew training manuals rules stowing devices reflect new guidelines ,0
 The FAA said already received plans airlines expand use portable electronic devices planes ,0
 Delta JetBlue among airliners already submitted plans ,0
" &quot; Depending condition plan , could approve expanded use electronic devices soon , &quot; FAA said statement ",0
" Currently , passengers required turn smartphones , tablets devices plane &apos;s door closes ",0
" They &apos;re supposed restart planes reach 10,000 feet captain gives go-ahead ",0
 Passengers supposed turn devices plane descends land restart plane ground ,0
" Under new guidelines , airlines whose planes properly protected electronic interference may allow passengers use devices takeoffs , landings taxiing , FAA said ",0
 Most new airliners planes modified passengers use Wifi higher altitudes expected meet criteria ,0
" Laura Glading , president Association Professional Flight Attendants , welcomed changes ",0
" &quot; Once new policy safely implemented - &apos;re going work closely carrier - win-win , &quot; Glading said statement ",0
 We &apos;re frankly tired feeling like &apos; hall monitors &apos; comes issue ,0
" But connecting Internet surf , exchange emails , text download data still prohibited 10,000 feet , agency said ",0
" Passengers told switch smartphones , tablets devices airplane mode ",0
" So , still Words With Friends , online Scrabble-type game actor Alec Baldwin playing smartphone 2011 famously booted American Airlines jet refusing turn device plane parked gate ",0
 And heavier devices laptops continue stowed concern might injure someone go flying around cabin ,0
 In-flight cellphone calls also continue prohibited ,0
" Regulatory authority phone calls belongs Federal Communications Commission , FAA ",0
" FAA may lift ban electronic devices takeoff landing Last month , National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker , CBS News national transportation safety expert , said cell phones still considered risk ",0
" &quot; Cell phones , really issue , potentially could create interference navigational devices , know , according FCC , could interfere cell phone towers &apos;re air , &quot; Rosenker said ",0
 An industry advisory committee created FAA examine issue recommended last month government permit greater use personal electronic devices ,0
 Pressure building FAA recent years ease restrictions use ,0
 Critics Sen,0
" Claire McCaskill , D-Mo ",0
" , contend valid safety reason prohibitions ",0
 The restrictions also become increasingly difficult enforce use devices become ubiquitous ,0
 Some studies indicate many third passengers forget ignore directions turn devices ,0
" The FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use electronic devices 1966 response reports interference navigation communications equipment passengers began carrying FM radios , high-tech gadgets day ",0
" New airliners far reliant electrical systems previous generations aircraft , also designed approved FAA resistant electronic interference ",0
 Airlines offering Wi-Fi use cruising altitudes passengers several years ,0
 Planes modified Wi-Fi systems also resistant interference ,0
" The vast majority airliners qualify greater electronic device use new guidelines , Huerta said ",0
 Today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions previous generations devices ,0
" E-readers , example , emit minimal transmissions turning page ",0
 But transmissions stronger devices downloading sending data ,0
 Among pressing relaxation restrictions passengers &apos; use devices Amazon,0
com,0
" In 2011 , company officials loaded airliner full Kindle e-readers flew around test problems found none ",0
 FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings whether use devices presents risk ,0
 Douglas Kidd National Association Airline Passengers said believes interference devices genuine even risk minimal ,0
" Other committee members said anecdotal reports pilots support devices interfere aircraft systems , reports old ",0
" However , committee recommended FAA allow pilots order passengers shut devices instrument landings low visibility ",0
" A travel industry group welcomed changes , calling common-sense accommodations traveling public bristling technology ",0
" &quot; We &apos;re pleased FAA recognizes enjoyable passenger experience incompatible safety security , &quot; said Roger Dow , CEO U",0
